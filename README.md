## 🔍 Summary  
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes workforce compensation across multiple states, departments, and demographic categories.  
The goal is to help HR and management teams monitor salary distribution, identify gender pay gaps, and understand departmental performance trends.  

With a clear design and dynamic filters, this dashboard allows users to analyze:  
- Total Salary distribution by State and Department  
- Average Salary, Male and Female Salary comparisons  
- Departmental and Employee counts  
- Salary trends over selected years (2006–2013)

## 🧩 Business Problem  
In large organizations, HR teams often struggle to gain quick insights into employee compensation data scattered across states, departments, and roles.  
Manual reports can’t easily show where salary imbalances exist or which departments are driving the largest payroll expenses.  

The absence of a centralized, visual analytical tool makes it difficult to answer:  
- Which states or departments have the **highest salary spending**?  
- Is there a **gender-based salary gap**?  
- How do salary trends evolve over time?  
- Which departments or job groups contribute most to total compensation?  

Without this clarity, HR leaders risk budget inefficiencies and unbalanced compensation structures.

**Key goals include:**  
1. Identify which **states** have the highest total salaries and employee counts.  
2. Compare **average salaries** across genders and departments.  
3. Explore **department-wise total compensation** to understand cost distribution.
